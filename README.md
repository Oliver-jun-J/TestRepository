# About the project that I am interested in

* I found an interesting project which is a COVID-19 out break simulation. 
* You can change factors like "age distribution", "hospital beds", "population" and so on.
* This simulation is intended to explore the dynamic of the epidemics out break, and benifit the health care system in the future.
